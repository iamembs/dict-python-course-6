"""
Web Application is a computer program that performs tasks 
over the Internet by making use of web browsers.

Web Development refers to the conceptualization, creation, and 
deployment of web apps and application programming interfaces, 
or APIs.

Web Program
* Front-end
    The front-end or client-side is the information sent to the 
    browsers. These will be presented to the users when they 
    navigate the site.
* Back-end
    The back-end refers to the programming done in the server 
    and the database.

Web Server
    The web-server sends information to the browser. It responds 
    to requests made by the user navigating a website.

Protocol
    It is the specific format of a requests.

Databases are where information is contained and can be accessed, 
viewed, updated, and modified.
* Relational database
    Uses tables - rows and columns to organize the data. It also
    makes use of SQL (Structured Query Language)
* Non-relational database
    Uses key-value pairs or a document storage model and is also 
    called NoSQL databases because they dont use SQL. Examples 
    are MongoDB and Redis.
 
Web API
    This provides a set of rules for how the web applications' 
    data should be interacted with. They also function as an 
    intermediary between the user and the website/app.

HTTP
    It stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol which allows web 
    applications to communicate, retrieve resources, and exchange 
    data. It works as a request-response protocol between a client 
    and the server.
* HTTP requests allows users to access content on the internet. 
Once an HTTP request is made, the servers will respond by displaying 
the resources to the user.

TCP
    It stands for Transmission Control Protocol. It is the intermediary 
    between the client and server; in charge of disassembling the data 
    into smaller parts before sending it over the network, and then 
    reassembling it once it reaches its destination.
IP 
    An IP is in charge of the computer's communication, addresses, sends, 
    and receives the data over the internet.

* The GET method is used to request data from a specified resource.

HTTPS (Secure)
    It is an extension of HTTP that guarantees security; incharge of 
    protecting data exchanged by encrypting it.

* A web framework is a library of codes that simplify web development.
Frameworks make it easier to reuse code.
